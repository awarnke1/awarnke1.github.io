            <p class="analysis">
                In AP Science, there was a 15 percentage point deficit between male and female students offered the subject who took it.
                The gap was only 8 percentage points in AP Mathematics, and there was an even smaller gap for AP Foreign Language.
            </p>

            <p class="analysis">
                Only 37% of students who were in the top decile of their high school class and who planned to attend a Texas public university,
                which qualified them for the Top 10% Rule, were male.
                Among students outside the top decile who did not plan to attend a Texas public university, over half were male.
            </p>

            <h3>Race</h3>

            <img class="graph" src="figures/percent_take_ap_top5_race.png" alt=""/> 
            <p class="analysis">
                Over half of students interested in going to a top 5 Texas university took AP Science when offered,
                and a higher percentage of minority and other/unreported race students took the subject than white/Asian students.
                In AP Mathematics there was a 15 percentage point deficit between white/Asian and minority students.
                This pattern was reversed for AP Foreign Language; 10 percentage point more minority students took the subject when offered
                than white/Asian students.
            </p>

            <img class="graph" src="figures/white_ratios_by_cat.png" alt=""/>
            <p class="analysis">
                Over 50% of students in the top decile of their high school class were white.
                Of students outside of the top decile and not planning to go to a Texas public university,
                only 40% were white.
